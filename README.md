## üåå Vision

Space is not just the next frontier ‚Äî it is the shared commons for humanity‚Äôs freedom and progress.  
Overby Industries is pioneering **planetary‚Äëscale power and propulsion** systems that merge deep‚Äëspace physics with breakthrough electrochemical engineering.  
Our mission: to unlock *practically unlimited Delta‚ÄëV* so humanity can travel, settle, and thrive beyond Earth.

## ‚ö° Core Concept ‚ö°Ionic-Liquid and Solar-Wind Ion Propulsion ABEP Dual-Mode Thrusters & Magnetohydrodynamic Generator + Lorentz Rail Accelerator ‚ö°
- Overby Concept: Dual-mode ion thrusters (space + atmospheric ABEP) and MHD-Lorentz drives powered by solar wind capture.
- NASA/ESA R&D:
  - Ion propulsion (NASA‚Äôs Dawn mission) already proven for deep space.
  - Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) has been tested at ESA for harvesting residual atmosphere in LEO.
  - Magnetosail / Electric Sail concepts (Janhunen, Pekka 2006; NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC)) propose using solar wind particles for thrust and power.

## Conclusion: ‚úÖ Strongly supported, expanding on existing experimental propulsion concepts.

This repository explores an integrated system for **dual‚Äëmode electric power and propulsion**, combining:

- **Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Generation**  
  Harnessing plasma interactions using safe and stable ionic-liquids for onboard electric power.

- **Ion Atmospheric‚ÄëBreathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP)**  
  High‚Äëefficiency thrust in-atmosphere or within low Earth orbit & near‚ÄëEarth regimes, drawing from ambient atmosphere.

- **Ionic‚ÄëLiquid Thrusters**  
  Precision, high‚ÄëISP propulsion for interplanetary navigation.

- **Solar Wind Ion Capture**  
  Harvesting charged particles in deep space, enabling sustained incremental Delta‚ÄëV gain and an effectively "renewable" thrust supply.

Together, these concepts create a **closed‚Äëloop system**: the engine is also the power plant, enabling spacecraft with unprecedented endurance, flexibility, and reach.

## ‚úÖ Bottom Line:
What you‚Äôre converging on is a magneto-fluid-dynamic power system where:
- Plasma + ionic liquids generate both electricity and thrust in one integrated system.
- Each miner/refinery carries its own self-contained mini-MHD ionic-liquid reactor power module.
- Starlifter II provides large scale deep space transport.
- Process autonomy: Refining stations keep running long after a Starlifter departure. When the shuttle comes around again, it picks up processed materials.

That turns your asteroid mining site into a continuously running industrial plant instead of a one-shot mission.

This is *radical* but rooted in solid physics and emerging electrochemistry. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of architecture that could work in a future asteroid-mining fleet.
